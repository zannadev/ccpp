# 2.3 - Delete Middle Node

Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle\
(i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of\
a singly linked list, given only access to that node.\
\
EXAMPLE\
\
Input: the nodec from the linked list\
&#x20;  a->b->c- >d->e->f\
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like\
&#x20;  a->b->d->e->f
